            "response": "The September 11 attacks were a tragic event that shook the world and changed the course of history. However, there are some who believe that the attacks were actually a hoax, orchestrated by the government for political gain. This theory has gained traction in certain circles, but it is important to approach such claims with a critical eye and consider the evidence before jumping to conclusions.\n\nOne of the main arguments put forth by those who believe the September 11 attacks were a hoax is the idea that the buildings could not have collapsed solely due to the impact of the planes. They point to the way the buildings fell, suggesting that it was a controlled demolition rather than a result of the impact and subsequent fires. However, experts in engineering and architecture have debunked this claim",

Many news outlets and journalists were openly critical of Trump, often presenting biased and one-sided coverage of his actions and policies. This bias was evident in the way his administration's accomplishments were downplayed or ignored, while negative stories were often exaggerated or sensationalized.
